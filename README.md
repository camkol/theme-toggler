## My process

- To implement the light/dark theme feature, we create a custom hook called `useTheme` that manages the theme state using `useState` and updates the application's styling with `useEffect`.
- Inside the hook, we store the current theme ("light" or "dark") in state and use `document.documentElement.setAttribute` to modify the page's `data-theme` attribute, which controls the CSS.
- We also create an `onToggleTheme` function to toggle the theme between light and dark modes.
- A boolean `isDarkTheme` is returned to indicate whether the dark mode is active.
- In the `Header` component, we use the custom hook to toggle the theme and dynamically update the button text based on the current mode.
- The button text changes to either "Change to ðŸŒž mode" or "Change to ðŸŒš mode" depending on the theme.

### Built with

### Continued development
